# Deep Learning Classification with TensorFlow

This repository demonstrates how to build and train a deep neural network using TensorFlow for a classification task. The project provides insights into the workings of neural networks, particularly focusing on how they learn and optimize their performance through backpropagation.

## Introduction

In the era of big data, deep learning has become a cornerstone technology for solving complex classification problems. This project leverages TensorFlow, one of the most popular deep learning frameworks, to construct a neural network capable of making accurate predictions on a classification dataset.

### Learning Mechanism

A deep neural network learns by adjusting its weights and biases during the training process. It does so by minimizing the loss function, which measures how far the model's predictions are from the actual labels. This adjustment is done through a process called backpropagation, where the network updates its parameters to reduce the error in future predictions.

### Project Goals

- **Understand the Basics of Neural Networks**: Gain a deeper understanding of how neural networks function, including the forward and backward passes.
- **Build a Classification Model**: Implement a deep neural network using TensorFlow to classify data into predefined categories.
- **Evaluate Model Performance**: Analyze the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Setup Instructions

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HedyehRahmani/Prediction-Employee-Attrition.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Model

After setting up your environment, you can run the model training script with the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

This command will load the dataset, preprocess the data, and train the neural network model. The script will also output the evaluation results, including accuracy and other relevant metrics.

## Key Concepts

### Backpropagation

Backpropagation is a fundamental concept in neural networks, where the model updates its weights based on the error of its predictions. This process allows the network to learn and improve over time, making it more accurate in its classifications.

### Model Architecture

The neural network in this project is designed with multiple layers, each contributing to the model's ability to learn complex patterns in the data. TensorFlow's powerful abstraction allows for easy construction and training of these networks.

## Detailed Walkthrough

### Data Preparation

- **Data Scaling**: The data is scaled using z-score normalization to ensure that all features contribute equally to the learning process.
- **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

### Training the Model

The model is trained using TensorFlow's high-level API, which simplifies the process of building and optimizing neural networks. The training process includes:

- **Epochs**: The number of times the entire dataset passes through the network.
- **Batch Size**: The number of samples processed before the model's internal parameters are updated.
- **Optimizer**: The algorithm used to adjust the learning rate and improve the model's performance.

### Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the model is assessed using several metrics:

- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct predictions.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A table used to describe the performance of a classification model.
- **Classification Report**: A summary of the precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
